                <p>Koko was born in the San Francisco Zoo and was taken from her mother at age 1 to be treated for illness she came under the care of Penny Patterson who began teaching her sign language. She managed to learn about <b>100</b> signs in just <b>10</b> months and her vocabularly developed singificantly as she aged. More remarkable than her vocabularly was her ability to express herself. According to Patterson she had the capacity to convey her thoughts and personality and would even lie. She also painted and would even give the paintings names. She also cared for a kitten by the name of 'All Ball' who Penny got for her due to her desire to be a mother despite her infertility.</p>

                <p>Koko became an international celebrity, ending up on the cover of <i>National Geographic</i> twice and being visited by several celebrities. A fan of Mr Rogers Neighborhood, when Koko was visited by the real Fred Rogers she took his shoes off, something she had seen him do at the start of every episode of his TV show. Patterson also claimed that Koko, after being visited by Robin Williams, mourned Williams' death after being informed of his passing.</p>

            <h2 class = "apeh2">Scepticism</h2>
                <p>In 1982, as a follow up to his paper on <a href = "nim.html">Nim's</a> inability to acquire language, Herbert Terrace published a paper called 'Why Koko Can't Talk.' In it he argues that Koko's utterances are as devoid of meaning as Nim's and criticized Patterson not releasing any raw data or footage for scientists to analyse. Patterson has acknowledged Terrace's arguments by saying that Koko's abilities come from the fact that she and Koko were never seperated where as Nim had countless teachers, thereby not allowing him to develop a relationship in which he felt comfortable communicating.</p>
