                <p>
                Scientist Noam Chomsky famously believed that a capacity for language is something that we, as humans, are <b>born</b> with. He believed that due to the complexity of language environmental learning was simply not enough to account for language acquisition.</p>

            <p>
            While there were certainly those who shared Chomsky's ideas, others were on the exact opposite end of the spectrum, believieng that a chimp raised in a human family and using ASL could help bridge the communicative gap between animal and human. Seeking to get to the bottom of this debate was behavioral psychologist Herbert Terrace who began development on <i>Project Nim</i> in the early 1970s. The Project was intended to go further than Project <a href = "washoe.html">Washoe</a> had and to challenge Noam Chomsky's theories. Because of this the subject of the project was named 'Nim Chimpsky.'

            <h2 class = "apeh2">Project Nim</h2>
                <p>During the course of the project Nim learned 125 signs and knew to repeat the signs his trainers had taught him in appropriate contexts. However, Terrace concluded that Nim's vocabulary of signs was not worthy of the name 'language' and colleagues of his argued that Nim's true vocabulary count was closer to <b>25</b> than <b>125.</b></p>
                <p>Terrace also concluded that Nim did not show any evidence of understanding human grammar due to Nim using signs only as a means ob obtaining an outcome such as toys, food, or attention. His findings were published in his 1979 paper <i>'Can an ape create a sentence?'.</i> Terrace would come to similar conclusions about <a href="koko.html">Koko</a> later on.

            <h2 class = "apeh2">Controversy</h2>
                <p>In 2011 a documentary titled <i>'Project Nim'</i> made up of archival footage from the project's duration premiered at the <i>Sundance FIlm Festival</i> before releasing theatrically on 8 July 2011. It received a glowing reception but also caused a heavy wave of criticism to be directed towards Terrace, with many saying that he exploited Nim for his own gain. Terrace has voiced his displeasure with the documentary, claiming that it is an attack on him that fails to properly convey the <b>scientific significance</b> of the research.</p>
