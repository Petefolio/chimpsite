        <p>
            Born in Africa in 1965, Washoe was acquired from the <i>Holloman Aeromedical Laboratory</i> in New Mexico by Drs. Allen and Beatrix Gardner when she was ten months old. Washoe was one of many apes at the time who had been sold to the United States for experimentation after her mother was killed. She was once known as 'Kathy' but was renamed by the Gardners when they acquired her.

            Washoe was brought to the Gardners' home in June 1966. She was given several human companions who would sign to her constantly and introduce her to games and toys that would keep her mentally stimulated. This was the beginning of Project Washoe, the ultimate goal of which was to get Washoe to develop a two-way, linguistic relationship with the humans around her. At the age of 5 she was moved to the University of Oklahoma's Institute of Primate Studies in Norman, Oklahoma to be cared for by Roger and Deborah Fouts

            The Fouts and the Gardners both made an effort to only communicate with Washoe using American sign language in order to keep her linguistic learning consistent. Washoe followed a regular routine, did chores, and even went for rides in the family car. It was believed that by raising her similarly to a human child she would learn language like one. Washoe passed away in 2007 at the ripe old age of 42.

        <h2 id = "apeh2">Feats and Criticism</h2>
        <p>
            Washoe was said to have attained a vocabulary of more than 350 signs. Even more impressive than that was the fact that her trainers had observed her combining signs together to create new words. While looking at a swan in a body of water, Washoe signed the words 'water' and 'bird.' Similarly when she saw a thermos she signed the words <i>'metal',</i> <i>'cup'</i>, and <i>'drink.'</i> During Washoe's lifetime many were taken with her humanity which was crucial to the ventual founding of the <i>Great Ape Project.</i> This was founded with the goal of placing apes in the moral category of <i>"persons"</i> rather than <b>private property.</b></p>
        <p> Terrace also concluded that Nim did not show any evidence of understanding human grammar due to Nim using signs only as a means ob obtaining an outcome such as toys, food, or attention. His findings were published in his 1979 paper 'Can an ape create a sentence?'. Terrace would come to similar conclusions about <a href="koko.html">Koko</a> later on.

                    Few deny that Washoe has demonstrated an impressive emotional range and capacity for empathy during her lifetime, but whether or not she could truly communicate using ASL has been heavily disputed. Herbert S. Terrace did not see Washoe's signing of <i>'Metal'</i>, <i>'Cup'</i>, and <i>'Drink'</i> as an example of inventive language, instead believing that she was simply making three different signs. This argument has also been made against the swan example, with many believing that she was merely signing the fact that she could see both water and a bird. Terrace's skepticism was only exaserbated after studying a chimp named <a href="nim.html">Nim.</a>
