        <h2>Washoe</h2>
        <p>
            Washoe was a female common chimpanzee but the <b>first</b> of her kind in many other ways. She was the first non-human to communicate using <i>American Sign Language</i> as part of <i>Project Washoe which</i> was established by R. Allen Gardner and Beatrix Gardner at the University of Nevada, Reno.</p>
        <p>
            While she was born in Africa in 1965 Washoe was taken in by the Gardners in 1967 and raised like a human child. She was given clothes, a bed with sheets and blankets, and a schedule with chores to follow just to name a few things. At the age of 5 she was moved to the University of Oklahoma to be cared for by Roger and Deborah Fouts.</p>
        <p> 
            During the 40+ years of life that she had Washoe learned approximately <strong>350</strong> words of sign languages. But, did the upbringing and experimentation Washoe was subjected to bridge the gap between human and ape or were her abilities no more than mimickry? Click on her to learn more.

            <h2>Nim</h2> 
            <p>
                Born in captivity at a primate research center in Norman, Oklahoma, Nim Chimpsky was raised from when he was two weeks old by humans as part of <i>Project Nim.</i> Project Nim was started in an effort to disprove Noam Chomsky's idea that only humans were capable of developing language. 
            </p>
            <p>After two years Nim was moved to Columbia University where he was taught by several teachers to learn over <strong>125</strong> signs. Nim was also one of the first chimps to be celebrified for his learning of sign language. Project Nim was and still is mired in controversy, but did Nim truly know sign language?</p>

            <h2>Koko</h2>
            <p> 
               Arguably the most famous case of apes learning sign language, Koko was a female western lowland gorilla born at the San Francisco Zoo and lived most of her life in Woodside, California. She was raised and cared for by Francine Patterson with the support of <i>The Gorilla Foundation.</i></p>

            <p>
                After being featured on the cover of <i>National Geographic Magazine</i> in 1978 Koko was launched into stardom, gaining worldwide attention and visits from celebrities such as Robin Williams and William Shatner. All have been candid about their awe at Koko's vocabulary which, according to Patterson, included over <strong>1000</strong> signs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Koko's ability to sign has become known around the world, but it has been similarly scrutinized with her understanding of the signs she makes being called into question. You can learn more by clicking on her.
