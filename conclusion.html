        <h2>A hand grenade to the research</h2> 
        <p>
            Terrace's paper on Nim was the straw that broke the camel's back of ape language research. It led to a conference in 1980 which painted the research of those in the field such as Patterson as fraudulent. A damning post-conference press release caught the attention of the government bodies funding this research and funding was cut almost overnight. It has remained that way ever since.

        <h2>So can apes communicate?</h2>
        <p>
        The idea of being able to bridge the gap in communication between animal and human is a tantalizing one, one that many of us are excited by and choose to believe in as evidenced by Koko's celebrity status. But the evidence in Terrace's paper as well as in accounts from those who worked on Project Nim is quite irrefutable. Apes who were taught signs did not use them to communicate as we would. When they did sign it was because they were prompted to do so and they often made as many signs as they could from the list that they knew in order to brute force a response and be rewarded for doing so. While apes are undoubtedly increbily intelligent animals with their own unique means of communication and expression, those that were taught sign language used it like a dog trained to sit upon hearing the word 'sit.'</p>

        <p> But, why does that matter? Why did these apes need to be taught sign language? They were chosen to do so due to their closeness to us on a genetic/evolutionary level, but why was their closeness not enough? Why was their own unique means of communication not enough? How come we could only find value in these apes' ability to communicate if they were doing so as a human would?</p>

        <p>These are questions without direct answers, but the question regarding whether or not apes can sign is not one of them. <strong>No.</strong> They cannot use sign language to communicate as we do. But that's okay. They are still amazing, intelligent creatures with a capacity for compassion and a complex inner world. <strong>And that should have been enough for us to care.</strong></p>
